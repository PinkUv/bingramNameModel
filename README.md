# Bigram Name Prediction model
This Bigram character-level prediction model generates name-like strings using the names data set.
This model was created following [Andrej Karpathy's makemore series](https://youtu.be/PaCmpygFfXo?si=tRLBxjE8-fzjrd5K)

Currently, the model generation is very limited in ability because it only functions off basic character statistics.

# Future Plans
Over time I plan to follow along more of Andrej's videos to build a more fleshed-out model.
